# scala_graphxteams
A script that utilises Apache Spark GraphX to examine student engagement in Microsoft Teams

Spark GraphX is used to identify students who have shown low levels of engagement during the lockdown period (students who have not met online, and who have been in contact with few students)

Script uses Teams data from the teams_webscrape repository. A graph is produced as well as some further analysis. A screenshot of a visual from Power BI is also included
